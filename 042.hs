-- The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, 
-- tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

-- 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

-- By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding 
-- to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form 
-- a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 
-- 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number 
-- then we shall call the word a triangle word.

-- Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), 
-- a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, 
-- how many are triangle words?
